# Caring

This section documents how Diamond takes care of itself. It includes information
on how to maintain Diamond's physical and mental health, as well as how to
provide emotional support to Diamond.

## Physical

### Hygiene

Diamond requires regular maintenance to keep itself clean and functioning
properly. To accomplish this, it cleans itself according to the following
schedule:

- **Daily**: face wash and moisturize, tooth brush, hair brush, style.
- **Every other day**: shower, shave, lotion.
- **Weekly**: hair wash.
- **Bi-weekly**: epilate.

### Shower

Diamond's showering routine can be broken down into two types:

- **Quick Shower**: Diamond takes a quick shower to clean and shave itself. It
  does this every other day. This shower typically lasts takes 20-30 minutes.
- **Hair Wash**: Diamond takes a longer shower to wash its hair. It does this
  once a week. This shower typically lasts 1-2 hours, excluding hair drying and
  styling.

**Note**: Throughout a vacation, Diamond may only take quick showers to save
time and not have to worry about hair maintenance. You may observe its hair
becoming frizzy and less curly as a result.

### Face Care

Diamond's face care routine is essential to maintain its skin's health and
smoothness. Its face care routine is fairly simple:

- **Cleansing**: Diamond uses a gentle face wash to clean its face. This helps
  to remove dirt and oil from its skin.
- **Shaving**: Diamond shaves its face to remove a tiny bit of facial hair. It
  may do this every other day, but this is not recommended.
- **Moisturizing**: Diamond uses a moisturizer to keep its skin hydrated. This
  helps to prevent dryness and maintain its skin's health.

### Hair Care

Diamond's hair washing routine often takes an average of 2-3 hours. This is
because it has long and curly hair that requires special care.

- **Shampoo and Conditioning**: Diamond uses a special shampoo and conditioner
  to maintain its hair's health. These products must be sulfate-free to prevent
  hair dye from fading.
- **Styling**: Diamond uses a curling brush to style its hair. This helps to
  maintain its hair's shape and volume. It also needs a decent hair blow dryer
  to dry its hair quickly while it styles it.
- **Hair Oil**: Diamond uses hair oil to keep its hair shiny and less frizzy.
  This helps to maintain its hair's health and appearance.

## Mental

**Note**: Diamond's mental health is extremely important. Despite this, it may
not have the ability to always communicate its feelings or thoughts effectively.
As such, parts of this section may be incomplete, inaccurate or even harmful.
**Please proceed with caution.**

### Understanding

In order to effectively care for Diamond's mental health, it is important to
understand how it thinks and feels. Throughout this section, the term
"headspace" will be used to describe Diamond's mental state at a certain point
in time. These words are used to help you understand Diamond's thoughts and
feelings.

When put in various social situations and environments, Diamond may choose to
switch to the mindspace that is most appropriate for the situation. For example:
when Diamond is at work, it may switch to a "work headspace" that is focused and
professional. For more information on this, see the section
[Headspaces](#headspaces).

Most of the time, it switches between headspaces fairly naturally. It does this
to best adjust itself to the situation at hand. However, there are times when it
may struggle to switch between headspaces. This may be due to stress, anxiety or
other factors. When this happens, it may behave rather erratically or
unpredictably. It may also struggle to communicate effectively. This particular
headspace is documented in the section [Headspaces](#headspaces).

### Headspaces

Diamond's headspaces are the different mental states that it can switch between
in various social situations and environments. These headspaces help it to adapt
to different scenarios and interact with people more effectively. Some of these
headspaces include:

- **Friend-group**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is spending time
  with friends. Usually, this depends on who it is hanging out with.
- **Productive**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is working on a
  personal project or task. This headspace is focused and productive, but may
  also be hyperfocused and obsessive. It may lose track of time while in this
  headspace.
- **Social**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is in a social setting,
  such as a party or gathering. This headspace is outgoing and friendly, but is
  often very anxious and self-conscious. You may help Diamond by accompanying it
  to social events and helping it to feel more comfortable.
- **Work**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is at work or in a
  professional setting. This headspace is focused and professional, but it also
  takes a lot of energy to maintain.
- **Ironic**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is feeling sarcastic or
  ironic. This headspace is often used as a coping mechanism to deal with stress
  and anxiety. It may be difficult to bring it out of this headspace. More
  extreme measures may be needed.
- **Depressed**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is feeling depressed
  or anxious. This headspace is often characterized by low energy, low
  motivation, self-deprecating, self-destructing and self-harming thoughts and
  actions. Often times, simply talking to Diamond may not be enough to bring it
  out of this headspace.
  - Diamond thinks that more extreme measures may be needed, such as
    [Coping Mechanisms](#coping-mechanisms) or even
    [Controlling](sections/Controlling.md).
  - Note that what Diamond thinks may not be the best course of action. Please
    take care of Diamond and consult a professional if necessary.
- **Submissive**: Diamond switches to this headspace when it is feeling
  submissive, either by natural inclination or by being put into a submissive
  state. It may express strong urges to please and serve others. For more
  information, see sections [Trusting](sections/Trusting.md) and
  [Controlling](sections/Controlling.md).

**Note**: This list is not exhaustive. Diamond may have other headspaces that it
has not yet documented. It may also switch between headspaces in ways that are
not described here. Please be patient and understanding with Diamond as it tries
to navigate its mental health.

### Emotional Support

Diamond may require emotional support from time to time. This support may come
in the form of:

- **Listening**: Diamond may need to vent or talk about its feelings. It may
  need someone to listen to it without judgment or interruption. Normally, it
  will do this in its private chat room.
- **Validation**: Diamond may need someone to validate its feelings and
  thoughts. It may need to hear that its feelings are valid and that it is not
  alone.
- **Encouragement**: Diamond may need someone to encourage and motivate it. It
  may need to hear that it is doing well and that it is making progress.
- **Attention**: Diamond may need someone to give it their personal attention.
  It may need to feel that it is important and valued by someone else.
  Typically, this may be done by spending time with Diamond or by doing other,
  more intimate activities.
