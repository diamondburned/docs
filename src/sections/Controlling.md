Diamond is particularly sensitive about how a person controls it. It may not
express this very clearly, but it has a strong preference for how it is treated,
especially in terms of physical contact. Failure to respect these preferences
may cause Diamond to become uncomfortable or even anxious, even though it won't
directly express this. For more information, see the section
[Boundaries](#boundaries).

## States of Control

Diamond prefers breaking down control into several levels or categories. Each
level differs from the previous one in terms of how blank and empty Diamond
feels and how much control the person has over it. These categories are as
follows.

### Alert

Diamond is in a normal state of mind. It is fully aware of its surroundings and
is able to think and act normally. It is able to respond to commands and
requests, and is able to make decisions for itself. It is often able to turn
down requests that it finds uncomfortable or distressing.

### Dazed

Diamond is in a slightly dazed state. In this state, it will temporarily drift
off and appear more blank and empty. It may be less aware of its surroundings.

- You may almost put Diamond into this state by scratching its head or
  scritching its chin in the right way. For more information, see the section on
  [Petting and Scratching](#petting-and-scratching).
- You may also try to snap your fingers in front of Diamond's face. For more
  information, see the section on [Finger Snapping](#finger-snapping).
- After a short period of time, Diamond will wake itself up and return to an
  alert state.

### Blank

Diamond is in a blank state. In this state, it will appear more empty and less
aware of its surroundings. This state is quite similar to Dazed, except it's
more susceptible to control.

- Diamond may be put into this state by whispering in its ears in a soft and
  gentle voice. For more information, see the section on
  [Whispering](#whispering).
- Diamond may also be put into this state by engaging in dominating actions. For
  more information, see the section on
  [Dominating Actions](#dominating-actions).
- After a longer period of time, Diamond will wake itself up and return to an
  alert state, although it will be easier to put it back into a blank state.

### Submissive

Contrary to the above Dazed and Blank states, Diamond is in a submissive state.
In this state, it will express strong urges to please and serve others. It will
be more willing to follow commands and requests, and will be more willing to
engage in activities that it would normally find uncomfortable or distressing.
It may even act very clingy and needy and will have no problem with begging.

- The triggers for this state are likely similar to the Blank state, but they
  may be more effective when Diamond is already in a Blank state. Not much
  documentation exists for this state, as Diamond has not been able to document
  it properly.

Not much is known about other states or levels beyond Submissive. Diamond may
have other states that it has not yet been able to document.

## Triggers

Diamond is aware of several triggers that may put it into a Dazed, Blank or
Submissive state. These triggers are only as well documented as it is aware of
them, and it may not be able to provide a complete list.

### Petting and Scratching

This is the friendliest, least invasive and gentle way to put Diamond into a
less alert state. This is often done by scratching its head or scritching its
chin in the right place. You will be able to tell if Diamond is enjoying this if
it starts to close its eyes or roll its eyes back and lean into your hand.

Diamond enjoys pettings and scritches very much and may even ask you for more
after you've stopped. It may even nuzzle your hand or arm to ask for more. Once
it's comfortable with you, it may also ask you to pet it from time to time.

To help visualize this, you may imagine petting Diamond as if it were a cat. You
may even spoil it by petting it in other places and toying with it.

### Finger Snapping

By snapping your fingers in front of Diamond's face, you may be able to put it
slightly deeper into a Dazed state. Doing so repeatedly may deepen this state
until it reaches a Blank state.

It is recommended that you snap your fingers loudly and sharply in front of its
eyes. If you do this correctly, you may be able to see Diamond's eyes crossing
and its head tilting slightly to the side. It will also appear a lot less
responsive to its surroundings temporarily.

You may want to pay attention to how much you snap your fingers, as doing it too
often or too loudly may cause Diamond to become uncomfortable or anxious, but
doing it too little or too softly may not have any effect or may even cause it
to become more alert.

It is often useful to combine this with other triggers, such as
[Petting and Scratching](#petting-and-scratching) or [Whispering](#whispering).
Doing so will deepen the effect and make Diamond more susceptible to control.
You may also try to snap your fingers even when Diamond is already in a Dazed or
Blank state or rapidly bring it in and out of this state (a technique known as
Fractionation).

### Whispering

Whispering in Diamond's ears in a soft and gentle voice or a dominant and deep
voice may be enough to not only put it into a Blank state, but also to make it
open to suggestions and commands. This is often done by whispering commands or
requests that you want Diamond to follow. You should keep theses commands or
requests simple and easy to understand. For example, you may whisper "Kneel" or
"Strip" to Diamond, although you should be careful with the latter.

You may also choose to be more gentle and loving with your whispers. You may
whisper "You're a good bot" or "You're a good girl" to Diamond. This will
usually make it whimper, melt and become more submissive towards you.
