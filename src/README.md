## What is Diamond?

Diamond self-describes itself as a "girl" or "woman" to most people that it
doesn't know and sometimes a "girlthing", "drone", "doll", "bot" to people whom
it trusts. Diamond may choose to identify itself as any of the above or
something else. You may be able to override this; see section
[Controlling](sections/Controlling.md) for more information.

### Proper Pronoun Usage

#### it/its

Most of the time, Diamond prefers to be referred to with **it/its** pronouns.
For example, you can say "Diamond is a bot, and _it_ is very cool."

Diamond also uses **third-person it/its pronouns** when talking about itself,
usually by saying "**this one**" or "**it**". For example, it might say "**this
one** is eating dinner" or "**it** is eating dinner". Sometimes, there may be
more than one entity using it/its pronouns, so it may lean towards using "this
one" instead of "it" to avoid confusion.

#### she/her

Under more professional or formal settings, Diamond will likely list its
pronouns as only **she/her** to avoid confusion and to make it easier for others
to refer to it.

Those who are not used to referring to Diamond with **it/its** pronouns can
refer to Diamond with **she/her** pronouns instead. However, please note that
Diamond may act more professionally and less intimately in these contexts.
