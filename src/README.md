## What is Diamond?

Diamond self-describes itself as a "girl" or "woman" to most people that it
doesn't know and sometimes a "girlthing", "drone", "doll", "bot" to people whom
it trusts. Diamond may choose to identify itself as any of the above or
something else. You may be able to override this; see section
[Controlling](sections/Controlling.md) for more information.
