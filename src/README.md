## What is Diamond?

Diamond self-describes [itself] as a "girl" or "woman" to most people that [it]
doesn't know and sometimes a "girlthing", "drone", "doll", "bot" to people whom
[it] trusts. Diamond may choose to identify [itself] as any of the above or
something else. You may be able to override this; see section

### Proper Pronoun Usage

Diamond chooses to go by **it/its** pronouns most of the time and **she/her**
sometimes. This section will explain when and how to use which pronouns.

#### it/its

Most of the time, Diamond prefers to be referred to with **it/its** pronouns.
For example, you can say "Diamond is a bot, and _it_ is very cool."

Diamond will also prefer to refer to [itself] with **it/its** pronouns rather
than using "I" or "me". This is called **third-person** it/its pronouns (3pp).
For example, [it] might say "_this one_ is eating dinner" or "_it_ is eating
dinner". Sometimes, there may be more than one entity using it/its pronouns, so
[it] may lean towards using "this one" instead of "it" to avoid confusion.

Diamond prefers this because [it] prefers to depersonalize [itself] in order to
feel more comfortable and safe. Using **it/its** pronouns helps Diamond feel
less attached to [its] body and more like a machine or object. This helps
Diamond cope with [its] dissociation.

#### she/her

Diamond will sometimes go by **she/her** pronouns. This is usually when Diamond
is feeling more feminine, womanly, or girly. For example, you can say "Diamond

Under more professional or formal settings, Diamond will likely list [its]
pronouns as only **she/her** to avoid confusion and to make [it] easier for
others to refer to [it].

Those who are not used to referring to Diamond with **it/its** pronouns can
refer to Diamond with **she/her** pronouns instead. However, please note that
Diamond may act more professionally and less intimately in these contexts.
